- MySQL or MariaDB
- A web browser

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shar0ff/expense-tracker-php
2. Move the project folder into your local server's htdocs or www directory.
3. Set up database using creation_script.sql (optionally insertion_script.sql) to create the required tables.

## Print-Optimized Pages
The project includes `@media print` styles to produce clean, printer-friendly output.  
When you print pages (like categories or operations lists), unnecessary elements are hidden, and layouts adjust for a better print experience.

## Troubleshooting
- If you get "Permission denied" errors on upload, ensure `uploads/` is writable:
  ```bash
  chmod 755 uploads/
  or adjust ownership with chown according to your server environment.
